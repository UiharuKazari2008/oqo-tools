; S3ISCFG.DAT for UniChrome Family (Windows 2K/XP)
;   Configuration options for the SETUP program.
; The [S3Setup] section specifies overall setup behavior, and is also
;  used if no specific section exists for the detected hardware.

   ; Type: default is "Unattended"
   ;  "UserSetup" - standard wizard-style install.
   ;  "UserNoSelect" - like UserSetup, but no Min, Full, Custom choice.
[S3Setup]
;Type=UserSetup
;Type=UserNoSelect
Type=Unattended

   ; OS: specify an exact OS requirement.  If not found, Setup will work on
   ;   Win9x (16-bit setup) or NT/2K/XP (32-bit setup).  To require only one OS,
   ;   specify "Win95", "Win98", "NT40", "Win2000" or "WinXP".  "Win2K or WinXP"
   ;   will allow only Win2K or XP, not NT.
OS=WinXP or Vista or Win2000

   ; Large text in upper-left corner of setup window.  If "ProductLongName" isn't
   ;  found, will use "ProductShortName" instead;  defaults to "S3 Driver Setup".
   ;  If this is found, it replaces "S3" in the default text.  So if
   ;  ProductLongName is "Savage4", then the main title is "Savage4 Driver Setup"
   ; NOTE: "Product" should fit within 8 letters if possible, for 16-bit setups.
ProductLongName=VIA/S3G UniChrome Family Win2K/XP/Server2003 Display
ProductShortName=UChromeP

   ; Name displayed in Add/Remove Programs, or for the uninstall icon.
   ;   If this isn't specified, the default will be the product name followed
   ;   by the name of any *separate* utilities.  Utils installed in a driver
   ;   INF file don't have names we can extract easily.
UninstName=VIA/S3G Display Driver

    ; This sets up the version, and is used for some uninstalling functions.
    ;  By default, this is "1.00.00", but should be filled in with the real
    ;  version number of the product.
Version=22.00.01d

   ; Setup/Driver version, used for some uninstall functions.  Default is
   ;  "1.00.00", but should be filled in with the real driver version.

   ; Use BPP/XRes/YRes to specify the desired resolution and color depth when
   ;  installing a driver.  However, Windows may not use the supplied info if
   ;  it can't detect monitor type.  These can also be supplied as command line
   ;  arguments (e.g. "BPP=32 Xres=800 Yres=600")

XRes=800
YRes=480
BPP=32
Refresh=1

   ; SetOnlyIfVga: default is 0.  If 1, Setup only uses BPP/XRes/YRes if system
   ;  is in VGA mode.  If not in VGA mode, Setup ignores Bpp/XRes/YRes.

   ; Specify Reboot=0 to prevent setup from rebooting.  This has the same
   ;  effect as adding "NoReboot" to command-line for setup.  ConfirmReboot=0/1
   ;  is same as cmdline options "ConfirmReboot" or "NoConfirmReboot",
   ;  controlling whether user is prompted before rebooting.  The default is to
   ;  allow reboots.  If NoSilentReboot=1, then setup won't reboot if it's run
   ;  in Silent mode (with a -s);  if 0, setup will use the "Reboot" key value.
   ;  ConfirmSilentReboot default is 0.  Set to 1 for confirm, even in silent mode.

   ; Setup.exe                         Reboots, prompts for reboot

   ; Uninstall: specifies where the user can find the uninstall option.
   ;   Set to "Start Menu" to place it in the Start Menu, "AddRemove"
   ;   to put it in Control Panel->Add/Remove Programs area, or "Desktop"
   ;   to have a shortcut icon on the desktop.  Default is none.
Uninstall=AddRemove
UninstallUsing=s3minset

   ; Default is 0. If 1, won't ask user to confirm uninstall.
   ;   If 1, user must confirm when uninstalling.
UninstallPrompt=1

   ; Default is 0. If 1, uninstall will not show any progress dialog.
   ;   If 0, an uninstall progress dialog will be shown.
SilentUninstall=0
AllowUtilUninstall=1

   ; FindDeviceNum: defines which adapter to find if multiple adapters
   ;   exist.  Default is 0 = first adapter (i.e. PCI adapters found before
   ;   AGP).  1=2nd adapter, 2=3rd, etc. -1=last, no matter what number it is.

   ; Set "EndScreenDetail=1" to have the reboot prompt screen at the end
   ;   detail exactly what got installed (driver, names of utilities, etc.)
   ;   Default is to show a standard message, no details.
EndScreenDetail=1

   ; Source: either "Uncompressed" (default) or "CAB" (not supported yet).
   ;  "Uncompressed" means all necessary files are in uncompressed format
   ;  in source directory.  "CAB" means files are stored in an Ishield CAB file,
   ;  and must be extracted to TEMP directory before they can be installed.
Source=Uncompressed
;Source=CAB

   ; To have the setup program create a log file, specify that file's name here.
